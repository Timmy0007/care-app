We all know that Public health care system in Nigeria is a mess and accessing privatehealth care can be quite expensive . There are health companies trying to solve this problem but not many of them have been able to achieve much because a lot of them rely on the traditional system and not taking advantage of technology


Care-app is a website that provides a solution that is technology-drivem to support the Health Insurance company and private patients reduce cost of health care . Using this platform, patients can talk to doctors faster and cheaper than they would if they go to any hospital. And for any health insurance company that partners with us, they spend less on paying for doctors for consultation on our platfiorm than they would pay hospitals.
